## üìå Overview

This web application dynamically lists upcoming events in Sydney, Australia (or any specified location using query parameters). It fetches real-time data using the Ticketmaster Discovery API and displays it in a clean, user-friendly layout. Users can click on the "Get Tickets" button, submit their email, and be redirected to the original ticketing page.

## üìã How It Works

1. Events are fetched from Ticketmaster using a hardcoded or dynamic city and country code.
2. The events are displayed using Bootstrap cards.
3. When the user clicks on "Get Tickets":

   * A modal prompts them to enter their email.
   * After validation, the user is redirected to the original ticket page.
4. The data auto-refreshes every minute to ensure the event list is always current.
